Visual Ping is easy to use and intuitive. You just need to enter the hostnames or IP addresses of the sites or servers you want to ping, and click Start. Visual Ping will start sending packets of data to the destinations and measure how long it takes for them to respond. You will see the ping times displayed as lines on a graph, with different colors for each destination. You can also see the minimum, maximum, average and current ping times in milliseconds.

Visual Ping is not only useful for measuring network performance, but also for comparing and troubleshooting.
