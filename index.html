  <p>Hello!</p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
  My name is Sergey, and I am a freelance programmer specializing in developing mobile, desktop and cross-platform
  applications. My work involves using Python and Flutter, as well as GTK and Snapcraft
  in the process of Python development, and GetX in Flutter development. I work on the Ubuntu and MacOS operating
  systems
  and use the VSCode IDE for my projects.
  <br><br>
  My goal is to create high-quality applications that help people solve their problems and simplify their lives. I
  always strive to learn new things and improve my skills to stay updated with the latest technologies and trends in
  the software development world.
  <br><br>
  If you are looking for a qualified developer who can assist you in creating your next project, I would be happy to
  discuss potential collaboration opportunities.
