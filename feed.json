Do you want to see how fast and reliable your connections are in real time? If so, you should check out Visual Ping, a desktop application that lets you ping one or two hostnames or IP addresses and see colorful graphs of the results.</p>\n<p>Visual Ping is easy to use and intuitive. You just need to enter the hostnames or IP addresses of the sites or servers you want to ping, and click Start. Visual Ping will start sending packets of data to the destinations and measure how long it takes for them to respond. You will see the ping times displayed as lines on a graph, with different colors for each destination. You can also see the minimum, maximum, average and current ping times in milliseconds.</p>\n<p>Visual Ping is not only useful for measuring network performance, but also for comparing and troubleshooting. You can ping two destinations at the same time and see how they differ in terms of speed and reliability. You can also zoom in and out of the graph, pause and resume the pinging, and change the interval and size of the packets. If you want to share or save your results, you can take a screenshot of the graph or export the ping data to a file.</p>\n<p>Visual Ping is a must-have tool for anyone who cares about network performance and reliability. Try it today and see for yourself how Visual Ping can help you improve your network experience!</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"align-center\">Download</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://snapcraft.io/vping\"> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg\" alt=\"Get it from the Snap Store\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"> </a></p>",
